Vorwort zum neuen Lehrzielkatalog der ÖRG 
Die Österreichische Röntgengesellschaft hat sich seit vielen Jahren für die Belange 
der Ausbildung, Fort- und Weiterbildung eingesetzt und mit der Entwicklung und 
Durchführung der Facharztprüfung beschäftigt. Bereits 1982 wurde der erste 
Lehrzielkatalog Radiologie von Prof. Dr. H. Pokieser und Prof. Dr. H. Imhof 
herausgegeben. In den neunziger Jahren mit dem Beginn der freiwilligen 
Facharztprüfung erschien die nächste Version des Lehrzielkataloges der ÖRG. 1994 
legten wir für alle in Ausbildung befindlichen Kollegen eine schriftliche Unterlage vor, 
die sie im Rahmen der Vorbereitung zur freiwilligen Facharztprüfung benutzen 
konnten. Seither gab es elektronische Neufassungen einzelner Kapitel, jedoch keine 
Neuauflage eines umfassenden Lehrzielkataloges unseres Faches. 
 
Definitionen: Der Lehrzielkatalog ist eine komplette und strukturierte Auflistung der 
wichtigen Schlüsselwörter und Indexbegriffe aus jedem radiologischen Fachbereich. 
Der Lehrzielkatalog ist gleichermaßen für Primarärzte, ausbildungsverantwortliche 
Fachärzte wie auch für die in Ausbildung stehenden Kollegen gedacht, entsprechend 
der European Training Charter for Clinical Radiology (www.ear-online.org). 
 
Lernziel/Fragenkatalog: Der Lehrzielkatalog ist eine ausführliche 
Zusammenfassung der wesentlichen Ausbildungsinhalte, spezifischen Lernziele 
unter Einschluss von Fragen zu den einzelnen Wissensgebieten. 
Der nunmehr vorliegende, neu aufgelegte Lehrzielkatalog ist auf die Initiative und 
den Einsatz des ÖRG-Präsidiums unter Führung von Prof. Dr. H. Imhof 
zurückzuführen. Die vorliegende Fassung zeigt noch keine ideale Harmonisierung 
der Kapitel, ist jedoch in der Praxis bereits erprobt. In der Zwischenzeit sind 
zahlreiche Kollegen zur Facharztprüfung angetreten und haben diese bestanden. 
Der Lehrzielkatalog wird Primarärzten, ausbildungsverantwortlichen Radiologen und 
künftigen Kandidaten eine adäquate Hilfe in der Vorbereitung sein und bestätigt, 
dass die Radiologie in Österreich bestens organisiert ist und eine Ausbildung im 
Fachbereich ermöglicht, welche, nach den Kriterien der EAR ausgerichtet, sehr guten 
europäischen Standard aufweist.

Good Practice Guide for European Radiologists 
 
There is increasing demand for public accountability of doctors (1, 2, 3, 4). Some 
European countries have created public agencies to review hospital standards and 
national medical regulating bodies have increased their involvement in setting and 
monitoring the standards of care of doctors (5, 6, 7). The medical profession in 
Europe is regulated primarily by its own members and this self-regulation is based 
upon the premise that practice and performance of medicine can only be adequately 
reviewed by those with expertise in the field. However, patients are increasingly 
involved in decision-making and patient groups and government bodies in the 
assessment of performance and thus indirectly in regulation. It is therefore important 
that radiologists define criteria for good radiological practice in order to emphasise to 
these outside bodies that clear standards are being set down by the profession and 
that regulation is being performed against transparent criteria (8). 
 
This paper describes the principles of good radiological practice and of competence, 
care and conduct expected of a radiologist in all aspects of their professional work. 
Many of these criteria of good radiological practice are generic to all doctors, but 
some are relatively specific to the practice of radiology and the document will 
integrate them. As a guiding principle, all patients are entitled to good standards of 
practice and care from their radiologists. Essential elements of this are professional 
competence, good relationships with patients and colleagues and observance of 
professional and ethical obligations. However, for good radiological practice it is 
essential that adequate support staff and equipment is provided by the hospital or 
health care facility management. 
 
 Providing Good Quality Radiological Practice and Care Includes: 
 
 An adequate assessment of the patient's condition and symptoms and clear 
understanding as to the nature of the complaint to be investigated based on the 
information provided by the referring clinician and, where appropriate, discussions 
with the patient. 
 Arranging and providing the appropriate investigations for an individual patient in 
relation to the clinical diagnosis in such a way as to minimise risk and maximise 
the efficacy of diagnosis. 
 Ensuring that an appropriate assessment of the examination is made and a timely 
report issued and in particular, taking prompt action where this is clinically 
necessary. 
 Referring the patient to another radiologist or clinician where this is indicated. 
Radiologists should work within the limits of their professional competence. This is 
particularly relevant with regard to their experience in individual imaging 
modalities, their detailed knowledge of particular clinical subspecialties and their 

5 
 
personal ability and experience in interventional techniques. The radiologist 
should be willing to consult with colleagues, where the diagnosis may be difficult 
or knowledge may be inadequate. 
 Radiologists must be competent when making a diagnosis or arranging treatment, 
particularly, if interventional procedures are being undertaken. They should keep 
their clinical colleagues well-informed and be prepared to take over clinical 
responsibility for patients or share that responsibility with fellow clinicians (9). 
 They should issue accurate, explicit, and understandable radiological reports, 
which record the relevant radiological findings and provide clear guidance to the 
clinician on the likely diagnosis and preferred supplementary investigations. 
Where uncertainty exists, this should be made clear within the text of the report 
(10). 
 Rapid methods of communication should be used as an adjunct to the written 
report in situations of clinical emergency. These may include brief entries into the 
patient.’s medical notes or telephoning the medical staff who are responsible for 
the patient.’s medical care. In such circumstances it is the responsibility of the 
radiologist to ensure that the information has been received precisely, 
unambiguously and is fully understood. A record of the communication should be 
made in the report (11). 
 When prescribing drugs or treatment, they must have an adequate knowledge of 
the patient.’s medical history, medication and health needs and of the value and 
complications of particular treatments or drugs. 
 
 Provision of Facilities: 
 
 Radiologists should use the resources that are available as appropriately and 
efficiently as possible. 
 Radiologists should ensure that there is a clearly defined quality assurance 
system in place for equipment with special regard to image quality, equipment 
maintenance, equipment upgrades and radiation dose. The effect on radiation 
dose should take into account economic and social factors. 
 It is important that if the radiologist is concerned about his / her ability to 
investigate or treat a patient safely, either because of inadequate premises, 
equipment or other resources, then the radiologist should consider not to 
undertake the procedures. This may require the radiologist to record his / her 
concerns and the steps that they have taken to try to resolve them and convey 
them to management. 
 Advances in equipment in clinical radiology are rapid and have increased the 
diagnostic range and information and improved patient safety and comfort. It is  
recognised that the majority of departments of radiology or individual radiologists 
will not be able to provide or utilise the most modern equipment, but radiologists 
should ensure that the equipment that they use provides an examination, where 
the diagnostic sensitivity or specificity is not diminished. Where possible, the 
equipment used should be the most appropriate to evaluate the clinical problem 

6 
 
at the lowest risk to the patient. 
 
 Decisions about Access to Medical Care: 
 
 Investigations or treatment that radiologists provide or arrange should be based 
on the clinical judgment of the patient.’s needs and likely effectiveness of the 
treatment. 
 Views with regard to the patient.’s life-style, culture, beliefs, race, colour, gender, 
sexuality and disability, age or social or economic status, should not prejudice the 
treatment provided or arranged. 
 Radiologists must not refuse or delay treatment because they believe that 
patient.’s actions contributed to their condition. If the radiologist.’s beliefs might 
affect the advice or treatment that he / she provides, he / she should arrange for 
the patient to be investigated and / or treated by another radiologist. 
 Radiologists must endeavour to give priority to the investigation and treatment of 
patients on the basis of clinical need. 
 
 Radiologists Must Maintain the Level of their Clinical Practice: 
 
Radiologists should be prepared to improve their skills and performance where 
possible and must take part in regular educational activities, which maintain and 
further develop their competence and performance. This process of life-long learning 
is defined in the policy document of the UEMS on continuing professional 
development (CPD) and specifically for radiologists by the EAR/UEMS radiology 
section policy document (14). This scheme is based on the acquisition of credits 
granted when radiologists attend educational courses or scientific meetings or for 
local and individual educational activities such as reading or writing scientific 
literature, attending clinico-radiological meetings and grand rounds, audit and 
selfdirected and distance learning. 
 
Developing additional skills may be required due to technical developments, new 
imaging modalities or new interventional procedures and these should be learned in 
a well co-ordinated, structured manner, in order to ensure patient safety and clinical 
effectiveness. 
 
 Maintaining Radiologists.’ Performance: 
 
 Radiologists should work with colleagues to monitor and maintain the quality of 
care that is provided and maintain a high awareness of patient.’s safety. 
 Radiologists should take part in regular and systematic audit, recording the data 
honestly (15). Where necessary as a result of audit or in response to new 
developments and techniques, radiologists should ensure that they improve and 
develop their practice, through CME/CPD including, where appropriate, by 

7 
 
undertaking further training. 
 Radiologists should respond constructively to the outcome of reviews, 
assessments or audit of their performance and should ensure that adverse 
radiological events are recognised and reported in order to reduce the risk to 
patients (16, 17, 18). 
 Teaching and training radiologists should be willing to contribute to the education 
of students and colleagues. Teaching is a significant component of radiological 
work. The skills and practices of a competent teacher should be developed and 
trainees should be properly supervised. 
 
  Relationships with Patients: 
 
Radiologists should ensure that they respect the rights of patients to be satisfied, 
that the patient has understood the proposed examination or treatment and any 
significant risks or side-effects that may be associated with it. It is essential that 
patients should only give consent when all the appropriate information has been 
provided and that consent must be clearly and freely given (19). 
 Radiologists must treat information about patients as confidential and ensure that 
patients are informed about how information is shared within teams providing their 
care. Information should only be shared with a third party without the patient.’s 
consent or against the patient.’s wishes when there are exceptional circumstances 
and these must be clearly understood (20). They must not disclose information 
where it is not appropriate, or where the individual to whom it is disclosed is not 
involved in the direct care of the patient. 
 Radiologists must maintain the patient.’s trust by being polite, considerate and 
truthful and respecting the patient.’s privacy and dignity. They must recognise that 
patients may wish to decline to take part in teaching or research and that this 
refusal should not adversely affect their relationship with the radiologist. 
 Radiologists must respect the rights of patients to seek a second opinion. 
 
 Communication: 
 
 Radiologists should ensure that their communication with patients is good and 
that they listen to the patients and respect their views and beliefs. Information 
should be provided that the patients seek or need about their condition, treatment 
and outcome (21). 
 Where patients under radiologists.’ care have suffered harm through misadventure 
or any other reason, radiologists should act immediately to put matters right, if 
that is possible, and explain fully and promptly what has happened. 
 Radiologists must also protect patients from risk of harm posed by another doctor 
or other health care professional.’s conduct, performance or health (12). The 
safety of the patient must come first at all times. The appropriate authorities 
should be informed where serious concerns about a colleague.’s performance 
have arisen. If he / she has management responsibilities, he / she should ensure 

8 
 
that mechanisms are in place through which colleagues can raise concerns about 
risks to patients. 
 Patients who complain about the care or treatment they have received have a 
right to expect a prompt, open, constructive and honest response, including an 
explanation of what has happened and the patient.’s complaint must not prejudice 
the care or treatment that you provide. 
 Radiologists participating in research, must put the care and safety of the patient 
first and must ensure that approval has been obtained for research from an 
independent research ethics committee and that patients have given consent. All 
research must be conducted with honesty and intregrity. 
 
 Working in Teams: 
 
Radiological diagnosis and therapy is provided by multi-disciplinary teams including 
radiographers, medical physicists, nurses and supported by administrative staff, but 
this does not change the personal accountability of the radiologist. It is usually the 
responsibility of radiologists to lead the diagnostic / therapeutic team. 
 
The radiologist working in a team must respect the skills and contribution of 
colleagues and maintain good communication between members of the team and 
with colleagues outside the team. Radiologists need to recognise their team as well 
as their functional role in a department (18, 22). 
 
Radiologists must ensure that all team members understand their personal and 
collective responsibility for the safety of the patient and the team objectives, tasks 
and responsibilities. 
 
The radiologist must ensure, where tasks are delegated, either by a radiologist within 
a team or separately, so that the delegate is providing treatment or care on the 
radiologists behalf, that the person to whom the task is delegated is competent to 
carry out the procedure or provide the therapy involved. The radiologist will still be 
responsible for the overall management of the patient (23). 
 
If the radiologist refers a patient, he / she must be satisfied that the person to whom 
he / she has referred has the necessary skills and that the continuing management is 
properly monitored and managed. 
 
 Continuing Patient Care: 
 
Radiologists should be satisfied that when they are off duty, suitable arrangements 
are made for emergency radiological examinations to take place. Arrangements 
should involve clear communication between doctors. 
 
Radiologists must be capable of undertaking the tasks that may be required in an 

9 
 
emergency or in an out of hours service and should not perform tasks on-call that 
they are not competent to do during the working day (24). 
Departments or practices should establish a portfolio of examinations that can safely 
and reliably be offered out of hours by the radiologist on the on-call rota. The 
supervision of junior on-call staff must be real and by those who are competent to 
undertake the examination if required. Only those examinations which will affect 
immediately patient management should be performed. 
 
 Financial and Commercial Dealings: 
 
Radiologists must be honest and open in any financial arrangements with patients 
and should provide information about fees and charges before obtaining patient 
consent to treatment wherever possible. 
 
They must not exploit a patient.’s vulnerability or lack of medical knowledge when 
making charges for treatment or services. 
 
They must act in the patient.’s best interests when making referrals or providing 
arrangements for treatment and care and should not accept inducements, gifts or 
hospitality which may affect or may be seen to affect their judgment. 
  
Radiologists who have financial or commercial interests in the organisations 
providing the health care should not allow such interests to affect the way they 
investigate or treat patients. They should avoid conflicts of interest in financial or 
commercial enterprises for both themselves or their immediate family and the patient 
must be aware of their financial interest. 
 
If their health may put a patient at risk, they must seek advice from suitably qualified 
colleagues and not rely on their own assessment of the risk to patients.(12). 
 
 Quality of Radiological Care: 
 
Radiologists should try to ensure that the departments in which they work have a 
high quality of clinical care, images, image interpretation and results of interventions 
measured by outcome data. 
 
The quality of care in individual departments may be affected by the manpower and 
equipment resources available (25), but where possible radiologists should try to 
minimise waiting times and maximise the speed of the issue of a report (15). 
 
The development of standards of diagnostic accuracy and efficacy of most 
investigations is incomplete. Radiologists should, however, endeavour to identify the 
standards that are achievable in any particular area and attempt to ensure that they 
provide a quality of service, accuracy, effectiveness and efficacy, which falls within 

10 
 
those standards. 
 
Radiologists should ensure that there are systems in place to justify clinically each 
image examination based on national and local guidelines, and that the appropriate 
available imaging modality is used (26, 27). They should ensure that both patients 
and themselves are properly protected from unnecessary radiation and should be 
familiar with the implications to their practice of regulations relating to radiation and 
be fully aware of all the appropriate legislation, both European and national (28). 
They must understand and enforce the principles of radiological protection for the 
foetus and, where appropriate, for radionuclide imaging for nursing mothers. 
 
Ideally, all studies should be formally reported by an accredited radiologist or an 
appropriate delegate or trainee working under supervision to a level appropriate to 
their training and expertise. If staffing levels are inadequate, radiologists should 
ensure that a protocol of non-radiologist reporting in compliance with the 
EURATOM directive, is agreed with the management of the hospital or health care 
facility (28). 
 
The timing of the investigations and reports should be such that they will contribute 
to effective patient management. However, the ability of radiology departments to 
achieve target response times depends on the availability of adequate resources, 
equipment and personnel. The department should achieve an effective and timely 
communication of the report. 
 
Radiation dose should be kept to the minimum, as low as is reasonably practical, and 
appropriate monitoring of doses should be in place. Protocols should be in place to 
ensure the quality of examinations for all procedures in departments, with the 
appropriate indications. Interventional radiologists should keep a record of their 
practice and of complications. These should be available for periodic external review 
and should be based and compared with acceptable standards. Such standards exist 
in terms of complications, but outcome measures should also be developed 
systematically (8). 
 
Radiologists should endeavour to ensure that systems are in place to enable 
previous examinations to be reviewed and current examinations to be available to 
clinicians and to clinico-radiological conferences as appropriate. 
 
 Clinical Audit: 
 
Audit is the systematic critical analysis of the quality of radiological care, use of 
resources and the resulting outcome and quality of life of the patient and is an 
important part of radiological clinical practice. 
 
Clinical radiology departments should have a properly supported audit structure and 

11 
 
audit should be a regular activity. Radiologists should participate in audit activity, 
but time and financial support for this process is essential. 
Audit topics should include structure, process and outcome of radiological 
interventions. They should also include the appropriateness of the procedure, the 
complication rates of interventional radiologists and the success of an interventional 
procedure (15). They should also reflect the concerns, difficulties and potential 
problems experienced by patients and staff within the hospital and within the 
department. 
 
Radiologists should endeavour to establish mechanisms whereby discrepancies and 
errors of practice can be reviewed in a non-confrontational and confidential forum 
(16, 17). 
 
Maintenance and confidentiality of outcome, incidence, complications, errors and 
omissions is essential, if local audit is to be beneficial and if national comparisons 
are to be achieved. 
 
 Conclusion 
 
Radiologists practice in an environment which makes great demands on their 
knowledge, skills, ability to respond to change and to work in teams. 
This good practice guide outlines what should be expected of a radiologist and the 
facilities and framework required to support that expectation

intrazerebrale Blutung aus angiodysplastischer oder -degenerativer Genese) 
 
 Welche Ursachen zerebraler Ischaemien können grundlegend 
unterschieden werden? 
• Embolien bei cardialen Veränderungen (z.B.: Vorhofflimmern)

• transistorisch ischaemische Attacke (TIA, transient ischemic attack): 
Rückbildung des Defizits innerhalb von 24 Stunden. 
• Stroke (persistierender Schlaganfall): Dauer des neurologischen Defizits

 Frühere klinische Einteilung: 

25 
 
• reversibles ischämisch, neurologisches Defizit (PRIND, prolonged reversible 
ischemic neurological deficit): Rückbildung des Defizits länger als 24 Stunden, 
aber längstens 3 Tage; danach Symptomfreiheit. Dieser Begriff wird dzt. eher 
verlassen. 
• fortschreitender Schlaganfall (progressive stroke): Zunahme der danach mehr 
oder weniger bleibenden neurologischen Ausfälle 
• vollständiger Schlaganfall (completed stroke): mehr oder weniger 
vollständiges Fehlen einer Rückbildung der neurologischen Ausfälle 
 
 Welche morphologischen und funktionellen Methoden zum Nachweis 
einer akuten Ischaemie kennen Sie? 
• kranielle Computertomographie

CTPerfusion) = multimodale CT 
• kombinierte kranielle MR-Tomographie ( diffusionsgew. MRI, + Perfusions- 
MRI, + MR-Angiographie = multimodale MRT 
 
 Wie kann man im Akutstadium die jeweils günstigste Methode zur 
Diagnostik einer akuten Ischaemie bei geplanter Lysetherapie abschätzen? 
• Kranielle Computertomographie allein ist lt. Studienlage innerhalb der 
ersten 3 Stunden nur bei sicher bekanntem Symptombeginn ausreichend. 
• Alternative Methoden (id est: multimodale CT oder MRT) müssen logistisch 
rasch an Akutversorgung angebunden und auch entsprechend verfügbar sein. 
• Lt. Studienlage gelingt der sicherste Nachweis (auch für Nicht- 
Neuroradiologen) eines ischämischen Defizits mit der kombinierten MRT. 
• Bei fehlender Kenntnis des Symptombeginns ist kombinierte MRT das 
Mittel der Wahl, da hier physiologische Daten über die ischämische 
Gewebsschädigung und damit über die mögliche Blutungsgefährdung 
zugänglich werden. 
 
 Welche Modalität (CT, MRT) ermöglicht eine besonders sichere akute 
Blutungsbeurteilung? 
• Computertomographie � Magnetresonanztomographie, da heute ein 
zuverlässiger Blutungsausschluss auch mittels MRT möglich ist.

• nicht invasiv (MR, CT, Kontrastmittelgestützt) 
 
 Ischämische Hirnerkrankungen 
 
 Welche Infarktstadien können prinzipiell unterschieden werden? 
• Nekrosestadium: 
vom akuten Ereignis bis zum 3. Tag, Gewebeschaden durch Abfolge von: 
kritischer Blutflussverminderung (unter 15ml/100g/min) – zytotoxischem 
Ödem – interstitiellem Ödem. 
• Resorptionsstadium: 
ab dem 4. Tag nach dem Ereignis, es überwiegt die Phagozytose des 
nekrotischen Gewebes; das Ödem erreicht sein Maximum zwischen dem 3. 
und dem 5. Tag und wird in der 2. Woche nach dem Ereignis wieder 
ausgeschwemmt. 
• Organisationsstadium: 
In der 6. Woche sind Nekrose und Resorption weitgehend abgeschlossen. 
 
 Nennen Sie verschiedene Infarkttypen und deren Ursache! 
• Territorialinfarkte entstehen durch embolischen oder thrombotischen 
Verschluss einer oder mehrerer Hirnarterien (Infarkt aus 
makroangiopathischer Ursache). Die Größe dieser Infarkte hängt vom Ort des 
arteriellen Verschlusses, von der Wirksamkeit der leptomeningealen 
Kollateralen, sowie von der Zusammensetzung und vom Alter des 
Embolus/Thrombus ab. Mehrheitlich ist das kortikale Versorgungsgebiet der 
A. cerebri media sowie auch das der A. cerebri posterior betroffen. 
• Grenzzoneninfarkte sind Folge eines kritischen Perfusionsabfalls im 

27 
 
terminalen Versorgungsgebiet der langen penetrierenden Marklagerarterien. 
Obwohl insgesamt wesentlich seltener als Territorialinfarkte, kommen sie 
häufiger bei hochgradigen Stenosen oder Verschlüssen vorgeschalteter 
Arterien, vor allem der A. carotis interna od A. cerebri media vor (Infarkt aus 
makroangiopathischer Ursache). 
In den Großhirnhemisphären unterscheidet man die innere sowie die 
vordere/hintere Grenzzone. Die hinteren Grenzzonen sind am häufigsten 
betroffen. 
• Lakunäre Infarkte entstehen durch Verschluss kleiner penetrierender Arterien 
(Durchmesser <200 μm). Bei hoher Anzahl der Läsionen spricht man auch von 
einem status lacunaris. Als Ursache wird eine komplexe 
Gefäßwandschädigung angenommen (Lipohyalinose), die in erster Linie als 
Folge eines langjährigen Hypertonus gedeutet wurde (Infarkt aus 
mikroangiopathischer Ursache). Prädilektionsstellen sind: Stammganglien, 
Thalamus, Capsulae interna et externa, basis pontis und ventrikelnahe Anteile 
des zerebralen Marklagers. 
• Subkortikale arterioskierotische Enzephalopathie (SAE) oder vaskuläre 
ischämische Leukenzephalopathie. Diese ist eine Form der zerebralen 
Mikroangiopathie. Es findet sich eine diffuse Demyelinisierung und 
Vakuolisierung des zerebralen Marklagers, wobei die U-Fasern ausgespart 
bleiben. Es kommt rezidivierend zu leichtgradigen ischämischen Läsionen, 
sodass sich Hirnleistungsstörungen bis hin zur Demenz entwickeln können. 
 
 Nennen Sie einige wichtige neuroradiologische Fragestellungen bei einer 
geplanten kausalen Therapie der akuten Ischaemie mittels Thrombolyse! 
• Liegt eine zerebrale lschämie oder eine primäre zerebrale Blutung vor? 
• Wie viel Hirngewebe ist bereits irreversibel geschädigt und wie viel ist zwar 
infarktgefährdet, aber potenziell noch rettbar (tissue at risk)? 
• Besteht ein Verschluss einer der großen zerebralen Arterie, dessen 
Beseitigung sich lohnt? 
 
 Nennen Sie einige Infarktfrühzeichen und Thrombuszeichen die bei 
größeren Territorialinfarkten bereits nach 2.—3 Stunden erkannt werden 
können! 
• Fehlende Grau-/Weißdifferenzierung, insbesondere im Bereich des 
Inselkortex (loss of the insular ribbon). Bei Infarkten mit Beteiligung der 
tiefen grauen Substanz, der Stammganglien, ist der Dichteausgleich 
zwischen Linsenkern und capsulae interna et externa (obscuration of the 
lentiform nucleus) ebenfalls schon früh nachzuweisen. Ursächlich ist in allen 
diesen Fällen die Minderperfusion und das Ödem in der grauen Substanz. 
• Fokales Verstreichen der Rindenfurchen: Verengung und „Verschwinden.“ 
von Hirnfurchen sind oft nur durch den Vergleich mit der kontralateralen 
Großhirnhemisphäre zu erkennen. Bei größeren Infarkten im Territorium der 
cerebri media kann sogar die Sylvische Fissur bzw. die Inselzisterne 

28 
 
verstreichen. 
• Hyperdensität der A. cerebri media: Dieses auffällige Zeichen ist bei 
ungefähr der Hälfte aller Mediaverschlüsse zu beobachten. Es kommt 
dadurch zustande, dass der Thromboembolus im Hauptstamm der A. cerebri 
media infolge physikochemischer Veränderungen an Dichte zunimmt und 
direkt sichtbar wird. Manchmal ist das Phänomen auch bei Verschlüssen von 
Mediaästen nachweisbar. Hierbei handelt es sich nicht um ein 
Infarktfrühzeichen im engeren Sinn. 
 
 Was versteht man unter einem malignen Mediainfarkt? 
• Wenn in der CT schon früh über die Hälfte des Versorgungsgebiets der A. 
cerebri media hypodens erscheinen, droht die Entwicklung eines 
lebensgefährlichen malignen Mediainfarkts. Bei einem solchen Infarkt, der 
mit Massenverschiebungen und Störungen der Liquorzirkulation einhergeht, 
sind engmaschige Verlaufskontrollen erforderlich. Das geschieht zunächst 
klinisch und computertomographisch, macht schließlich aber oft den Einsatz 
intrakranieller Drucksonden nötig. In verzweifelten Fällen kann eine 
operative Dekompression (Entdeckelung) lebensrettend sein. 
 
 Wie ist die diffusionsgewichtete MRT-Bildgebung bei akuter Ischaemie 
zu interpretieren? 
• Mit diffusionsgewichteten Sequenzen (diffusion weighted imaging [DWI]) 
kann der akute Hirnfarkt bereits wenige Minuten nach einem 
Gefäßverschluss erfasst werden. Das früh eintretene zytotoxische Ödem 
schränkt die Wasserdiffusion ein, weshalb das infarzierte Hirngewebe in der 
diffusionsgewichteten MRT sein hohes Signal behält, während das gesunde 
Hirngewebe, infolge einer größeren mittleren freien Diffusionsstrecke einen 
Signalverlust erleidet und dunkel erscheint. Auf den ADC-Bildern (ADC von 
engl.: apparent diffusion coefficient, scheinbarer Diffusionskoeffizient) kehrt 
sich der Kontrast zwischen Infarkt und gesundem Gewebe um: Das 
Infarktareal erscheint hier dunkel, das normale Gewebe hell. 
• Auch wenn diffusionsgewichtete Veränderungen partiell reversibel sein 
können, nimmt man derzeit an, dass die Hyperintensität in der 
diffusionsgewichteten MRT das irreversibel geschädigte Hirngewebe im 
Zentrum einer Ischaemie markiert. 
 
 Welche Störgrößen müssen bei der diffusionsgewichteten MRT-Bildgebung 
beachtet werden? 
• Interpretationsfehler bei der DWI-Auswertung treten dann auf, wenn die 
Protonenbeweglichkeit nur unidirektional, also anisotrop, untersucht wird 
(Verwechslungsmöglichkeit: physiologisch, strukturell bedingte 
Einschränkung der mittleren freien Diffusionsstrecke mit ischaemischer 
Schädigung, wobei etztere die Protonenbeweglichkeit in alle 
Raumrichtungen einschränkt). Abhilfe: Untersuchung der Diffusion mit 

29 
 
isotropem Messansatz mit Erfassung -Protonenbeweglichkeit in zumindest 
den 3 Hauptraumebenen. 
• Bei alten unbekannten vaskulären Läsionen mit T2-Verlängerung des 
Gewebes kann ein sog. T2 shine-through.“ Effekt auftreten, der dann auf 
den diffusionsgew. Bildern ein helles Signal ergibt. Abhilfe: Berechnung von 
ADC-Bildern und Akquisition von T2-gewichteten Aufnahmen. 
• An der Schädelbasis treten immer wieder Suszeptibilitätsartefakte auf, die in 
diffusionsgewichteten MRT-Bildern Hyperintensitäten erzeugen. Abhilfe: 
Berechnung von ADC-Bildern, bzw. Bildverzerrungen beachten. 
 
 Erklären Sie das „match–mismatch“ Konzept bei Durchführung einer 
kombinierten MRT-Untersuchung beim akuten Schlaganfall aus ischaemischer 
Ursache! 
• Die vergleichende Analyse von diffusionsgewichteten Bildern (DWI) und 
Perfusionsbildern (P-MRI) geht von der Annahme aus, dass die DWI 
Signalveränderungen dem irreversibel geschädigten Gewebe (dem sog. 
Infarktkern) entsprechen, während die P_MRI - Veränderungen das gesamte 
minderperfundierte Hirnareal darstellen. Die Korrelation der Ausdehnung der 
DWI-Abnormität mit derjenigen der P-MRI-Abnormität ergibt entweder eine 
Deckungsgleichheit (match) oder aber eine Ungleichheit (mismatch). Bei 
Ungleichheit kann das perfusionsgestörte Areal oder das diffusionsgestörte 
Areal größer sein. Ist das perfusionsgestörte Areal größer (P-MRI > DWI), 
wird das Differenzareal als Korrelat für das Gewebe betrachtet, das noch 
nicht infarziert, aber hochgradig gefährdet ist (Penumbra, tissue at risk). 
 
 Nennen Sie einige Ursachen für scheinbar paradoxe 
Infarktausprägungen bzw. das Auftreten einer Kollateraleninsuffizienz! 
• Posteriorinfarkt bei Gefäßprozess der ACI bei embryonaler Variante der P2- 
Segmentversorgung mit hypoplastischem P1-Segment. 
• Infratentorielle Infarkte aus der vorderen Strombahn bei persistierender Art. 
trigemina primitiva. 
• Grenzzonen- bzw. Endarterieninfarkt im ACA-Stromgebiet kontralateral zu 
ACI-Prozess bei hypo- bzw. aplastischem kontralateralem A1-Segment. 
• Aussparung des caput ncl. caud. Bei komplettem Verschluss der art. cerebri 
media bei (üblicher) Versorgung dieser Struktur durch die A. recurrens 
Heubner aus der homolat. ACA. 
 
 Nennen Sie einige typische Symptome eines Ponsinfarktes und geben 
Sie die Untersuchungsmodalität der Wahl an! 
• Ponsinfarkte entstehen typischerweise paramedian im mittleren Brückenfuß 
und äußern sich klinisch in einer motorischen Hemiparese, die meistens 
arm- und distalbetont ist und initial oft von einer Dysarthrie begleitet wird; die 
für Hirnstamminfarkte als charakteristisch geltende „gekreuzte Symptomatik.“ 
fehlt oft. Hirnnervenausfälle je nach Lokalisation. 

30 
 
• Untersuchungsmethode der Wahl ist die MRT. 
 Benennen Sie einige Ursachen einer Mangelversorgung des Gehirns! 
• akute zerebrale Hypoxie durch Stagnation des Blutflusses (Ischämie) 
• Hypoxie aus hypoxämischer, toxischer oder hypoglykämischer Ursache 
 Welche Veränderungen finden sich bei durch Hypoxie bedingten 
Schäden? 
• bei passagerer Hypoxie ist oftmals der Cortex reversibel beeinträchtigt. 
• Kortikale Störungen können dabei auch asymmetrisch ausgeprägt sein. 
• Häufig sind die Grenzzonen, die sog. „letzte Wiese.“; betroffen. 
• Im Vollbild entstehen kortikal laminare Nekrosen. 
• Es finden sich Ödeme und mitunter Bluthirnschrankenstörungen. 
 
 Mit welcher Modalität untersucht man die akute Hypoxie, bzw. ihre 
Folgezustände am besten, welche Veränderungen finden sich? 
• Am besten wird mit der MRT untersucht. 
• Die Differenzierbarkeit der Hirnrinde und der subkortikalen weißen Substanz 
ist herabgesetzt. 
• Die Hirnfurchen verstreichen. 
• Bei einer Hirnschädigung durch globale Hypoxie dehnt sich das Hirnödem 
auf die Stammganglien, das Kleinhirn und den Hirnstamm aus. 
 
 Welche morphologischen Veränderungen können am Gehirn, bedingt 
durch eine Vaskulitis, auftreten? 
• Zerebrale Vaskulitiden führen oft zu multiplen, teilweise konfluierenden 
Arealen erhöhter Signalintensität (T2w) in den Großhirnhemisphären, 
paraventrikulär und auch weiter peripher im Marklager, in der MRT. 
• Mitunter können nach stattgehabten Blutungen Hämosiderinreste in der 
MRT auftreten. 
• Bei verschiedenen Autoimmunerkrankungen. (SLE, Periarteriitis nodosa,Mb. 
Behçet) kann es zu einer Mitbeteiligung des Gehirns mit perivaskulärer 
Infiltration kommen. 
• Perivaskuläre Entzündungen sind nicht auf die kleinen Arterien beschränkt, 
sodass ein Mischbild von gleichzeitig mikroangiopathischen und 
hämodynamischen, mitunter auch territorialen Infarkten vorkommt. Dieses 
Läsionsmuster ist charakteristisch, aber für sich allein nicht beweisend für 
eine Vaskulitis. 
 
 Welche morphologischen Veränderungen können an den Gefäßen, 
bedingt durch eine Vaskulitis, auftreten? 
• Wandentzündungen kleiner und mittlerer Arterien können zu einer 
segmentalen Gefäßerweiterung mit Ausbildung von (Pseudo-) Aneurysmen 
führen. Vor allem bei SLE rupturieren letztere mitunter und führen zu 
intrazerebralen Blutungen.

• Zudem finden sich aber auch Gefäßverengungen und Gefäßverschlüsse. 
 
 Welche bildgebenden Verfahren können in der Frage nach einer 
Vaskulitis sinnvoll eingestetzt werden, und was ist ihr Stellenwert? 
• Zur radiologischen Sicherung der Diagnose einer Vaskulitis ist die selektive 
zerebrale Angiographie notwendig, da mit dieser Methode arterielle 
Stenosen, Verschlüsse und Aneurysmen am verlässlichsten nachgewiesen 
werden können. 
• Zur Bestimmung der zerebralen morphologischen Schäden ist die MRT die 
Methode der Wahl. 
 
 Was versteht man unter einer zerebralen Mikroangiopathie, welches 
morphologische Erscheinungsbild hat sie? 
• Die zerebrale Mikroangiopathie als Erkrankung primär des Marklagers 
manifestiert sich mit Iakunären Einzelläsionen von 1.—2 mm Durchmesser 
oder als konfluierende spongiöse Demyelinisierung. 
• Selten tritt die zerebrale Mikroangiographie auch primär mit flächigen 
Hypodensitäten im subkortikalen Marklager in Erscheinung, wobei in 
extremen Fällen außer den U-Fasern das gesamte Marklager einen 
homogenen Befall zeigen kann, entsprechend einer subkortikalen 
arteriosklerotischen Enzephalopathie. 
 
 Welche wichtige, nicht primär zerebrovaskuläre Differentialdiagnose ist 
bei der zerebralen Mikroangiopathie zu berücksichtigen und worauf ist zu 
achten? 
• die Unterscheidung der Mikroangiopathie von 
Demyelinisierungserkrankungen, besonders der Encephalomyelitis 
disseminata, kann schwierig sein 
• die zerebrale Mikroangiopathie befällt nicht den Balken und die deutlichste 
Ausprägung findet sich eher in einigem Abstand von den Seitenventrikeln 
(paraventrikulär) 
• Demyelinisierungserkrankungen befallen zumeist den Balken und betreffen 
unmittelbar die Region um die Seitenventrikeln (periventrikulär) 
 
 Was versteht man unter dem Begriff CADASIL und welche Befunde sind 
bei dieser Erkrankung zu erwarten? 
• CADASIL steht für: cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with 
subcortical infarcts and leukencephalopathy 
• Beginn der Erkrankung oft schon im 3. Lebensjahrzehnt 
• Entwicklung einer subkortikalen Demenz 
• rezidivierende zerebrale Durchblutungsstörungen führen zumeist zu 
symmetrisch verteilten, zunächst periventrikulär lokalisierten Gliosen 
• ein Befall der Capsula externa ist bei dieser Erkrankung im Vergleich zur 
Mikroangiopathie charakteristisch 

32 
 
• Stammganglien sind deutlich seltener betroffen sind als bei der zerebralen 
Mikroangiopathie 
• im Spätstadium der Erkrankung ist zumeist das gesamte zerebrale 
Marklager betroffen (Abgrenzung zur schweren zerebralen Mikroangiopathie 
ist dann bildmäßig fast nicht möglich) 
 Welche diagnostischen Maßnahmen sind bei Verdacht auf CADASIL 
sinnvoll? 
• Anamnese: Patienten sind in der Regel wesentlich jünger als jene mit einer 
subkortikalen artherosklerotischen Encephalopathie; Zumeist liegen keine 
typischen Gefäßrisikofaktoren vor. 
• Bildgebung: Vor allem in der MRT sind Hyperintensitäten in typischer 
Verteilung (siehe oben) in T2-gewichteten Aufnahmen nachzuweisen. 
• Genetik: Die Diagnosesicherung ist durch den Nachweis eines Gendefekts 
auf Chromosom 19p13 möglich. 
 
 Welche zumeist harmlosen Veränderungen sollte man nur beobachten, 
bzw. von den zerebrovaskulären degenerativen Veränderungen abgrenzen? 
• Erweiterte perivaskuläre Spalten, die Virchow - Robin - Räume begleiten die 
perforierenden Arterien und sind für sich belanglos. Da sie jedoch einerseits 
im fortgeschrittenen Alter, andererseits bei ausgeprägter Hirnatrophie 
auftreten, ist eine Beobachtung sinnvoll. 
• Bildgebendes Verfahren der Wahl ist die MRT. 
 
 Hirnblutungen 
 
 Welche bildgebenden Verfahren sind einzusetzen in der Diagnostik der 
intrakranialen Blutung? 
• Der Nachweis einer akuten Blutung gelingt schnell und sicher mit der CT, 
heute auch mittels MRT. 
• Subakute und chronische Blutungen samt ihren Residuen sind in der MRT 
verlässlicher nachzuweisen. 
• Bei Abklärung der Ätiologie kann, bei nicht ausreichender diagnostischer 
Sicherheit in der CT-Angiographie und/oder der MR- Angiographie, 
zusätzlich die invasive zerebrale Angiographie erforderlich sein. 
 
 Wie häufig liegt eine Blutung der klinischen Diagnose: Schlaganfall 
zugrunde? 
• Spontane intrazerebrale Blutungen ereignen sich fast doppelt so oft wie 
nichttraumatische Subarachnoidalblutungen. 
• Insgesamt machen beide Erkrankungen knapp 20% aller Schlaganfälle aus. 
 
 Erklären Sie Demographie und Verlauf der meisten Blutungen! 
• Das Risiko an einer intrazerebralen Blutung zu erkranken, steigt nahezu 
proportional mit dem Alter. 

33 
 
• Männer sind häufiger betroffen als Frauen. 
• In der Altersgruppe bis 45 Jahre sind Subarachnoidalblutungen häufiger als 
intrazerebrale Blutungen. 
 
 Welche Ursachen von Blutungen kennen Sie? 
• Die arterielle Hypertonie wird als bedeutsamster Risikofaktor in der 
Pathogenese intrazerebraler Blutungen angesehen. Zusätzlich gelten 
Amyloidangiopathie, Alkoholismus, die Einnahme von Antikoagulantien etc. 
als Risikofaktoren. 
• Subarachnoidalblutungen sind überwiegend Folge einer Aneurysmaruptur. 
Eine AVM kann ebenfalls vorliegen, diese verursacht jedoch auch, neben 
einer Subarachnoidalblutung eine rein intrazerebrale Blutung. 
• Selten führen Tumoren, Vaskulitiden ebenfalls zu intrazerebralen Blutungen. 
 
 Wie sind die Untersuchungsmodalitäten CT & MRT bei Blutungen zu 
bewerten? 
• Aussagekraft der Methoden hängt vom Zeitpunkt der Untersuchung ab. 
• Die diagnostische Sicherheit kann durch Kombination von Verfahren erhöht 
werden (z.B.: KM-Gabe, angiographische Darstellungen etc.). 
• Eine zerebrale Angiographie ist zumeist entbehrlich. 
• Die CT ist beim Nachweis frischer arterieller Blutungen die Methode der 
Wahl. 
• Bei Subarachnoidalblutungen lassen sich innerhalb der ersten 72 Stunden in 
der CT selbst geringe Blutmengen im Subarachnoidalraum nachweisen. 
Danach geht die Dichteanhebung wieder rasch zurück, vor allem durch 
Vermischung des Bluts mit dem Liquor und durch Resorption. 
 
 Erläutern Sie den Verlauf der akuten intrazerebralen Blutung in der CT! 
• Akute intrazerebrale Blutungen und Subarachnoidalblutungen erscheinen in 
der CT als hyperdense Bezirke mit Dichtewerten zwischen 40 und 90 HE. 
Der hohe Dichtewert beruht überwiegend auf den ausgefällten Proteinen des 
Blutes. Der Hämoglobinabbau führt zu einer Dichteabnahme von etwa 2 HE 
pro Tag. 
• Gegen Ende der ersten Woche entsteht ein hypodenser Saum bei 
Verkleinerung der zentralen Hyperdensität. 
• Danach wird die Blutung je nach lnitialgröße innerhalb von 3-6 Wochen 
allmählich hypodens, wobei sie ein hirnisodenses Stadium durchläuft. 
• Mit Abschluss der Resorption bilden sich die Raumforderungszeichen 
zurück, und es entsteht der endgültige, manchmal überraschend kleine 
Parenchymdefekt. 
• Nach KM-Gabe kommt es in der CT während der Resorptionsphase oft zu 
einem Ring-Enhancement am Rand des Hämatoms, das mit ähnlichen 

34 
 
Phänomenen bei Hirnabszessen und Tumoren verwechselt werden kann. 
 
 Erklären Sie die Einblutungsmechanismen! 
• Intrazerebrale Blutungen sind primär Rhexisblutungen aus Arteriolen oder 
kleinen Arterien. Dies wird besonders für hypertensive Massenblutungen 
angenommen, gilt aber auch für die sekundäre Einblutung in einen 
ischämischen Infarkt. 
• Bei der hämorrhagischen Transformation eines ischämischen Infarkts kommt 
es dagegen zu Diapedeseblutungen infolge gestörter Endothelfunktion. 
• Blutungen infolge venöser Stauung, Enzephalitis oder entzündlicher 
Wandveränderungen werden zumeist als Diapedeseblutungen gesehen. 
 
 Stellen Sie den Verlauf der akuten intrazerebralen Blutung in der MRT 
dar! 
• Bei der Untersuchung mit Hochfeldgeräten (>1 T) und SE-Sequenzen lassen 
sich aufgrund des Signalverhaltens mehrere Stadien der Hämatomevolution 
definieren. In GRE-Sequenzen liegen zutdurchgeführt werden. 
• Die akuten charakteristischen Signalveränderungen bei der Resorption der 
Blutung beruhen auf der Umwandlung von Oxyhämoglobin über 
Desoxyhämoglobin in zunächst noch intrazelluläres Methämoglobin. 
• In der subakuten Phase der Blutung kommt es zur Lyse der Erythrozyten, 
die in der 2. Woche nach zentral fortschreitet. Durch die Bildung von 
extrazellulärem Methämoglobin entsteht sowohl in T1- als auch in T2- 
gewichteten Aufnahmen eine starke Signalerhöhung. 
• In der chronischen Phase (etwa ab der 3. Woche), wenn Makrophagen vom 
Rand der Blutung einwandern und das Hämoglobineisen in Form von 
Hämosiderin und Ferritin einlagern, zeigt sich das Hämatom in T2- 
gewichteten Aufnahmen zentral hyperintens, aber peripher kommt es zu 
einer ausgeprägten Signalminderung. Dieser mehr oder minder schmale 
Saum prominenter Hypointensität markiert bis zur vollständigen Resorption 
die wahre Größe der Blutung, da er sich scharf gegen das (hyperintense) 
perifokale Ödem abgrenzt. Nach der Resorption des Hämatoms markiert er 
langfristig dessen Residuum. 
• Angesichts der initial raschen Variabilität der Signale liegt der diagnostische 
Vorteil der MRT primär in der Erfassung von subakuten und chronischen 
Hämatomen und deren exakter Lokalisation in muliplanaren Darstellungen. 
• GRE-Sequenzen zeigen einen homogeneren Verlauf mit überwiegend 
hypointenser Dartstellung der Blutung. 
 
 Welche Blutungsursachen gibt es und welche nicht invasive Modalität 
(CT oder MRT) sollte zur Anwendung kommen? 
• Die angiographisch meistens stummen kavernösen Hämangiome oder 
Cavernome, die charakteristischerweise neben frischen auch ältere 
Blutungsanteile enthalten, werden mit der MRT weit häufiger erkannt. 

35 
 
• Auch AV-Malformationen sind meist leichter mit der MRT als mit der CT zu 
erfassen 
• Venöse Angiome, die manchmal auch einen kavernösen Anteil haben, 
werden ebenfalls in der MRT besser erkannt. 
• Sinusthrombosen als Blutungsursache sind bei kombinierter Anwendung von 
MRT und MRA meistens verlässlich nachweisbar. Die hochauflösende 
Kontrast-CT mit CT-Angiographie liefert jedoch ebenfalls verlässliche 
Befunde. 
• Auf einen Tumor als Ursache einer intrazerebralen Blutung weisen oft das 
gleichzeitige Bestehen mehrerer Blutungsstadien nebeneinander, sowie eine 
verzögerte Resorption, in derselben Läsion hin. Auch dies ist leichter mit der 
MRT erfassbar. 
 
 Welche typischen Blutungslokalisationen kennen Sie? 
• Stammganglien- und Thalamusblutungen machen mehr als die Hälfte aller 
intrazerebralen Blutungen aus. 
• Weitere häufige Blutungslokalisationen sind Lobärhämatome, vor allem bei 
der Amyloidangiopathie. 
 
 Hypertensive Massenblutung 
 
 Nennen Sie Ursachen der hypertensiven Blutung und häufige 
Lokalisationen! 
• Es besteht bei der zerebralen hypertensiven Gefäßerkrankung eine 
Degeneration der Gefäßwandmuskulatur mit Entwicklung von 
Mikroaneurysmen und Lipohyalinose. Von diesen Veränderungen betroffen 
sind primär die perforierenden Stammganglienarterien, die penetrierenden 
Ponsarterien und die Kleinhirnarterien. 
• Blutungen in den Stammganglien (Putamenblutungen ca. 30%, caput nuclei 
caudati ca. 5%) und im Thalamus (ca. 20%) sind ätiologisch meistens 
hypertensive Massenblutungen. Auch bei Kleinhirn- und Ponsblutungen (ca. 
5%) wird der Hochdruck als Hauptursache angesehen. 
 
 Welche Komplikationen der Blutung sind zu berücksichtigen? 
• Größere und/oder ventrikelnahe intrazerebrale Blutungen brechen häufig in 
das Ventrikelsystem ein. 
• Blutkoagel im Ventrikelsystem, sowie, bei größeren Blutungen, der massiv 
raumfordernde Effekt können zu Ausbildung eines Hydrocephalus führen. 
 
 Wie können Verlaufskontrollen von Blutungen effizient durchgeführt 
werden? 
• CT-Verlaufskontrollen sind ausreichend 
• Nur bei ungeklärter Blutungsursache, müssen weiterführende radiologische 
Untersuchungen, wie CT-, MRT-, manchmal auch eine intraarterielle 

36 
 
Angiographie, im subakuten oder chronischen Stadium der Blutung 
wiederholt werden. 
 
 Subarachnoidalblutungen 
 
 Was ist die häufigste Ursache einer Subarachnoidalblutung? 
Die häufigste Ursache einer Subarachnoidalblutung ist das Aneurysma. 
 Welche zusätzlichen Befunde und Folgen einer Subarachnoidalblutung 
sind zu berücksichtigen? 
• In etwa 20% liegt zusätzlich eine intrazerebrale Blutung vor. 
• Es kann zu einer hochgradigen intrakraniellen Druckerhöhung kommen, die 
nicht selten zu einer globalen zerebralen Perfusionsstörung mit initialem 
Bewusstseinsverlust führt (etwa 20% der Patienten versterben innerhalb von 
Minuten bis Stunden). 
• Es treten oft bleibende deutliche fokal neurologische Defizite auf. 
• Es treten häufig schwere Hirnödeme auf. 
• Es kann sich ein Hydrocephalus occlusus (z.B.: Blutkoagel etc.) oder 
malresorptivus (posthämorrhagisch) ausbilden. 
• Oft tritt nach 3 - 4 Tagen der sog. Vasospasmus auf, der bis zu zwei 2 
Wochen anhalten kann und in ca. 30% der Fälle zu ischämischen Infarkten 
führt. 
• Rezidivblutungen haben eine zumeist infauste Prognose (in ca. 50% der 
Fälle innerhalb der ersten 6 Monate). 
 
 Wie weist man neuroradiologisch am schnellsten eine 
Subarachnoidalblutung, bzw. eine mögliche Blutungsquelle nach? 
• Eine rasche Diagnostik ist mittles CT möglich. Ca. 2% der 
Subarachnoidalblutungen sind jedoch auch im CT negativ. 
• Mittels der CT-Angiographie ist auch bereits die Mehrzahl der 
Blutungsquellen nachweisbar. 
• Eine intraarterielle Angiographie muss zumeist nicht akut durchgeführt 
werden, bei negativem Blutungsquellennachweis in den nichtinvasiven 
Verfahren, ist sie jedoch weiterhin angezeigt. 
• Die intraarterielle Angiographie erfasst zudem auch den Vasospasmus, 
wobei neuere nicht invasive Verfahren, allem voran die Perfusions-MRI und - 
CT, in der Bewertung des damit verbundenen Durchblutungsmangels 
weitreichender sind. 
 
 Kann man immer eine Blutungsquelle nachweisen? 
Nein, in ca. 20% aller Subarachnoidalblutungen ist eine Blutungsquelle selbst 
nach Wiederholung der Angiographie nicht nachweisbar. In diese Gruppe 
fallen auch die meisten Patienten mit umschriebener perimesenzephaler 
Blutung, die eine besonders günstige Prognose hat. 
 

37 
 
 
 
 Andere Gefäßerkrankungen 
 
 Welche Gefäßerkrankungen kennen Sie, die vermutlich aus kongenitaler 
Ursache oder aus dem Zusammenwirken angeborener und erworbener 
Störungen entstehen? 
• Gefäßmissbildungen (Aneurysmen etc.) 
• Moya-Moya-Syndrom 
• fibromuskuläre Dysplasie 
 
 Aneurysmen 
 
 Wie definieren Sie Aneurysmata, bzw. deren Inzidenz und Ätiologie? 
• Aneurysmata sind umschriebene permanente Gefäßerweiterungen, die 
durch Aussackungen an Schwachstellen der Gefäßwand entstehen und 
vorzugsweise an Gefäßverzweigungen auftreten. 
• Aneurysmen sind sie die häufigste Ursache der nicht traumatischen 
Subarachnoidalblutung und verursachen rund 25% aller intrakraniellen 
Blutungen. 
• Die Inzidenz liegt in der Gesamtbevölkerung bei 1 %.‚ nach Autopsiestudien 
sogar bei bis zu 9%. 
Man unterscheidet echte (98%) und falsche Aneurysmata. 
 
 Gibt es Erkrankungen bei denen Aneurysmata besonders häufig 
vorkommen? 
• Marfan-Syndrom 
• Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrom Typ IV 
• tuberöse Sklerose 
• fibromuskuläre Dysplasie 
• polyzystische Nierenerkrankung 
• familiäre Häufung 
 
 Nennen Sie einige häufige Lokalisationen von Aneurysmata? 
Mehr als 80% liegen im vorderen Anteil des Circulus Willisii (besonders: A. 
comm. anterior) 
 Nennen Sie Ursachen Typen echter Aneurysmata? 
• mykotische, infektiöse und entzündliche Aneurysmata 
• Aneurysmata bei Erkrankungen des Bindegewebes (z.B.: bei 
fibromuskulärer Dysplasie, Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrom, Pseudoxanthoma 
elasticum). 
 
 Welche Syndrome gehen mit zerebralen A. einher? 
 Nennen Sie Ursachen falscher Aneurysmata? 

38 
 
• traumatische Aneurysmata (Folge einer direkten Schädigung der 
Gefäßwand) 
• dissezierende Aneurysmata (entstehen spontan oder traumatisch) 
 
 Was ist bei der Sonderform des Riesenaneurysmas zu beachten? 
Riesenaneurysmata weisen ein Durchmesser von 10.—25 mm auf, darüber 
spricht man sogar vom gigantischen Aneurysma. 
Es treten oft Symptome, die durch die Raumforderung bedingt sind, auf. So 
können je nach Lage Symptome eines Tumors imitiert werden. 
Blutungsrisko und Gefäßbezug (evtl. ist Gefäßausschaltung zur Behandlung 
notwendig) 
 
 Welche Ziele verfolgt die neuroradiologische Diagnostik bei der 
Darstellung von Aneurysmata? 
• Darstellung des Aneurysmas (Form, Tochteraneurysmata etc.) 
• direkter Gefäßbezug (insbesondere Darstellung der Halsregion) 
• Nachweis oder Ausschluss von direkt aus dem Aneurysma abgehenden 
Gefäßen 
• Nachweis oder Ausschluss von Ödembildung 
• intraaneurysmatische Thrombosierungen 
 
 Gefäßmissbildungen 
 
 Welche Charakteristika treffen auf AV-Malformationen (AV-Angiome, 
AVM) zu? 
• AV-Malformationen (AV-Angiome, AVM) sind vermutlich genetisch bedingt. 
• AVMs zeigen eine Prävalenz von ca. 1 - 10/100000 Einwohner/Jahr. 
• Es bestehen häufig klinische Symptome unabhängig von einer Blutung 
(Krampfanfälle, Kopfschmerzen). 
• jährliches Blutungsrisiko ca 3% 
 
 Wie ist die Blutung aus einer AVM zu beurteilen? 
• Etwa 50% der AVM-Blutungen treten zwischen dem 20. und 50. Lebensjahr 
auf. 
• Ca. 66% dieser Blutungen sind intraparenchymale Blutungen, 
Subarachnoidalblutungen oder Ventrikelblutungen sind seltener. 
• Bei vorliegen besonderer Gefäßformationen einer AVM ist das 
Blutungsrisiko höher einzuschätzen (z.B.: bei Aneurysmata an zuführenden 
Arterien, venöse Stenose, Mikroangiom, Drainage überwiegend zum tiefen 
Venensystem). 
• Vorausgegangene Blutungen erhöhen ebenfalls das Blutungsrisiko auf das 
2-   bis 4fache. 
 

39 
 
 Welche neuroradiologischen Nachweisverfahren einer AVM sind 
möglich? 
• Bevorzugt ist die MRT einzusetzen, da die Gefäßstrukturen, etwaige Gliosen 
und alte Blutungsreste gut erkannt werden können. 
• In der CT sind Gefäßverkalkungen etwas besser differenzierbar. 
• Die intraarterielle Angiographie dokumentiert die Hämodynmik einer AVM 
am besten. 
 
 Welche Gefäßmissbildung außer der AVM mit klinischer Relevanz 
kennen Sie? 
• Kavernom 
• Telengiektasie (bes. Mesenzepholon) 
 
 Welche Relevanz kommt einem Kavernom zu? 
• Kavernome sind venöse Gefäßmalformationen. 
• Ihre Häufigkeit variiert zwischen 2 und 25% aller zerebrovaskulären 
Malformationen. 
• Die veranschlagte Prävalenz liegt bei etwa 0.5%. 
• Kavernome sind häufig klinisch stumm, der Anteil symptomatischer Läsionen 
bei den zerebralen Gefäßmissbildungen liegt unter 4%. 
• Kavernome können multipel vorkommen. 
• Zumindest bei familiär gehäuften Kavernomen konnte eine genetische 
Ursache identifiziert werden. 
 
 Welche neuroradiologische Nachweisverfahren eines Kavernoms sind 
möglich? 
• Kavernome lassen sich angiographisch kaum nachweisen. In der 
Angiographie sollen vor allem assoziierter Gefäßmissbildungen erfasst 
werden. 
• In der MRT ist die Sensitivität von GRE-Sequenzen beim Nachweis kleiner 
Kavernome bedingt durch die zumeist vorhandenen Blutabbauprodukte sehr 
hoch. 
• Die CT ist unspezifisch und erfasst eher Gefäßverkalkungen in Kavernomen. 
• Kontrastmittelgabe ist sowohl in der MRT als auch der CT unspezifisch. 
 
 Wie äußern sich Kavernome? 
• Klinisch treten häufig zerebrale Anfälle, seltener fokale neurologische 
Defizite auf. 
• Subarachnoidalblutungen sind selten, nur bei 15% der Kavernompatienten 
kommt es zu einer klinisch bedeutsamen Parenchymblutung. 
• Das Blutungsrisiko wird mit maximal 0,7% pro Jahr veranschlagt. 
• Symptomatische Kavernome weisen eine höhere Blutungsrate bis zu 4,5% auf. 
 

40 
 
 
 
 Durafisteln 
 
 Wo entsteht die traumatische Durafistel am häufigsten? 
Zwischen der A. carotis interna und dem Sinus cavernosus (sinus cavernosus 
Fistel). 
 Nennen Sie einige Charakteristika von nicht traumatisch entstandenen 
Durafisteln? 
• Bei den duralen AV-Malformationen handelt es sich zumeist um abnorme 
diffusretikuläre Kurzschlussverbindungen zwischen duralen 
(pachymeningealen) Arterien und duralen Sinus, duralen Venen oder 
leptomeningealen Venen. 
• Die Bezeichnung erfolgt zumeist nach ihrer Beziehung zum venösen Sinus. 
• AV-Malformationen können in Zusammenhang mit Sinusthrombosen, nach 
Operationen, Infektionen oder Schwangerschaften in Erscheinung treten. 
Durale AV-Malformationen sind 10-mal seltener als piale AVMalformationen. 
• AV-Malformationen der Okzipitairegion und des Sinus cavernosus sind 
häufig, jene am Sinus sagittalis superior, am tiefen Venensystem und an der 
Frontobasis selten. 
 
 Nennen Sie einige Symptome von duralen AV-Malformationen? 
• Die klinische Symptomatik hängt stark von der Lage und Ausprägung der 
Durafistel ab. 
• Kopfschmerzen, pulssynchrone Ohrgeräusche, pulsierender Exophthalmus, 
Hirnnervenparesen und die Ausbildung eines Hydrozephalus kommen vor. 
 
 Wie beurteilen Sie das Blutungsrisiko einer duralen AV-Malformation? 
• Hinweise auf einen gesteigerten Venendruck bedingen ein höheres 
Blutungsrisiko. 
• Abhängig von der venösen Drainage kann das Blutungsrisiko bis zu 50% 
betragen. 
 
 Welche neuroradiologische Nachweisverfahren setzen Sie zum 
Nachweis einer duralen AV-Malformation ein? 
• Die intraarterielle Angiographie ist die Methode der Wahl. 
• In der CT und MRT sind nur sehr ausgeprägte Fisteln zu erkennen, hier 
lassen sich eher die Komplikationen wie Ödeme, Blutungen oder ein 
Hydrozephalus nachweisen. 
 
 Arteriendissektion 
 
 Welche Ursachen einer Gefäßdissektion kennen Sie? 
• Überdehnungen der Halsgefäße durch Traumen oder extreme 

41 
 
Kopflewegungen (z.B.: chiropraktische Manipulation) können zur Dissektion 
führen. 
• Dissektionen treten zusätzlich auch spontan auf. 
• Mögliche Risikofaktoren sind arterielle Hypertonie, fibromuskuläre Dysplasie, 
Migräne, Medianekrose und Drogenmissbrauch. 
 
 Häufige Lokalisationen von Gefäßdissektionen? 
• An der A. carotis interna ist besonders der obere und mittlere Abschnitt des 
zervikalen Segmentes betroffen. 
• An der A. vertebralis treten Dissektionen vor allem subokzipital, seltener im 
intrathekalen Segment, auf. 
 
 Nennen Sie einige Symptome, die auf eine Dissektion hinweisen 
können? 
• Die Aufspaltung der Gefäßwand macht nicht immer Beschwerden. 
• Kopfschmerzen, und Schmerzen im Hals oder Nacken sind häufige 
Symptome. 
• Bei Karotisdissektionen kann oft ein postganglionäres Honersyndrom 
auftreten. 
• Es kommt mitunter zu hämodynamischen oder/und embolischen zerebralen 
Durchblutungsstörungen. 
 
 Welches neuroradiologische Nachweisverfahren setzen Sie zum 
Nachweis einer Dissektion bevorzugt ein? 
• Diagnostisch ist die MRT mit MR-Angiographie, am besten mit zusätzlicher 
Perfusions- und Diffusionsmessung, die Methode der Wahl. 
 
 Moya-Moya-Erkrankung 
 
 Wie läßt sich die Moya-Moya-Erkrankung beschreiben? 
• Die Ätiologie ist nach wie vor weitgehend unklar. Es besteht eine 3fach 
erhöhte lnzidenz beim Down-Syndrom, ebenso sind HLA-Haplotypen, 
Autoantikörper und Chromosomenaberrationen bei familiären Formen 
nachgewiesen worden. 
• Es kommt zu einer langsam progredienten, schließlich hochgradigen 
Stenosierung der basalen Hirnarterienstämme mit konsekutiver Ausbildung 
eines dichten feinen Kollateralennetzes. 
• Inzidenz in Japan (besondere Häufung) von 1: 1.000.000, wobei insgesamt 
überwiegend Kinder, Jugendliche und junge Frauen (70% der Patienten 
unter 20 Jahre) betroffen sind. 
• Der Begriff Moya-Moya, von japanisch für Rauch- oder Nebelschwaden, 
leitet sich aus dem angiographischen Bild, das die zahlreichen Kollateralen 
zeigt ab. 
 

42 
 
 
 
 Wie manifestiert sich die Moya-Moya-Erkrankung klinisch? 
• Beim Erwachsenen treten fast ausschließlich Subarachnoidalblutungen auf. 
• Im Kindesalter sind meistens durch ein ischämisch bedingtes Symptom zu 
beobachten. 
 
 Welches neuroradiologische Nachweisverfahren setzen Sie zum 
Nachweis einer Moya-Moya-Erkrankung bevorzugt ein? 
•  Die Erkrankung kann heute mit der MRT ausreichend verlässlich 
diagnostiziert und im Verlauf dokumentiert werden. 
• Die intraarterielle Angiographie weist eine erhöhte Komplikationsrate bei 
dieser Erkrankung auf. 
 
 Hirnvenen- und Sinusthrombose 
 
 Nennen Sie einige Ursachen einer Hirnvenen- bzw. 
Sinusvenenthrombose? 
• Infektiös-septische Thrombosen können nach eitrigen Entzündungen des 
Ohrs oder der Nasennebenhöhlen, nach Meningitiden oder nach septischer 
Streuung auftreten. 
• Häufig kommen Thrombosen bei exogener Hormonzufuhr, bei 
hämatologischen Störungen, posttraumatisch und auch ohne erkennbare 
Ursache vor. 
• Bei Kindern und Neugeborenen kann infolge einer Dehydratation oder 
Unterernährung eine Hirnvenen- oder Sinusthrombose entstehen. 
 
 Welche neuroradiologische Nachweisverfahren setzen Sie zum 
Nachweis einer Hirnvenen- bzw. Sinusvenenthrombose bevorzugt ein? 
• Die CT und die MRT erlauben auch den Nachweis von indirekten Zeichen 
(z.B.: diffuses oder fokales Hirnödem, hyperdenser Sinus, venöse Infarkte, 
okale Hyperämie). 
• Zum direkten Nachweis thrombosierter Gefäße muss eine venöse MR-
Angiographie 
oder CT-Angiographie durchgeführt werden. Zumindest ist 
eine kontrastmittelverstärkte Untersuchung angezeigt (nota bene: sog. 
empty triangle sign). 
• Nur bei nicht venös zuordenbarer Blutung in atypischer Lokalisation, nach 
Ausschöpfung der nicht invasiven Verfahren, ist eine intraarterielle 
Angiographie indiziert. 
 
 Infektionen des zentralen Nervensystems 
 
 Welche klinischen Manifestationen und intrakraniellen Entzündungen 

43 
 
kennen Sie? 
• Pachymeningitis 
• Leptomeningitis 
• Ependymitis, Ventrikulitis

 Erkrankungen der Blutgefäße des Rückenmarks 
 
Allgemeine Pathologie und Neurologie 
 
 Gibt es mehr oder weniger typische Verlaufsformen von spinalen vaskulären 
Prozessen? 
• Eine Blutung manifestiert sich in aller Regel akut. 
• Ischämische Myelomalazien zeigen ebenfalls einen akuten Verlauf, wobei 
jedoch in Vergleich zur Blutung ein etwas prolongierter Symptomverlauf 
besteht. 
• Vaskuläre Gefäßprozesse mit konsekutiver Myelopathie verlaufen subakut 
bis chronisch. 
 
 Nennen Sie einige Ursachen die spinalen Durchblutungsstörungen zugrunde 
liegen können? 
• Verschluss von Interkostal- oder Lumbalarterien durch ein dissezierendes 
Aortenaneuyrsma. 
• Massive Aortensklerose, arteriosklerotische Wandveränderungen der 
rückenmarkversorgenden Arterien direkt spielen jedoch kaum eine Rolle. 
• durale AV-Fisteln und AV-Malformationen 
• venöse, vertebrale Zirkulationsstörungen 
 
Allgemeines zum diagnostischen Vorgehen 
 

53 
 
 Welche neuroradiologischen Nachweisverfahren setzen Sie zum Nachweis 
einer spinalen Gefäßerkrankung ein und wie gehen Sie? 
• Akut aufgetretene Querschnittsymptome müssen immer rasch und 
notfallmäßig abgeklärt werden. 
• Die MRT ist das Verfahren der ersten Wahl! 
• Eine spinale Angiographie ist indiziert, wenn Klinik und MRT für eine spinale 
bzw. durale AVM sprechen. 
 
 Spinale Gefäßmissbildungen 
 
 Was ist die häufigste spinale Gefäßmissbildung und gibt es typische 
Symptome? 
• Durale AV-Fisteln (Durafisteln) sind die häufigsten spinalen 
Gefäßmissbildungen. Der AV-Kurzschluss liegt in der Dura mater. Er 
verbindet den duralen Ast eines R. spinalis mit einer Oberflächenvene des 
Rückenmarks 
• Die Symptomatik kann leicht mit jenen anderen Erkrankungen verwechselt 
werden (z.B.: multiple Sklerose, Spinalkanalstenose, Polyneuropathie, 
Querschnittmyelitis). 
 
 Häufigste Lokalisation einer spinalen Durafistel? 
• Die häufigste Form der spinalen Duralfistel zeigt eine Versorgung über eine 
thorakale oder lumbale Segmentarterie, wobei die venöse Drainage nach 
kranial oder kaudal über abnorm dicke perimedulläre Venen erfolgt 
• Zervikale und sakrale Durafisteln sind extrem selten. 
 
 Nennen Sie einige Charakteristika intraduraler spinaler AV-Malformationen? 
• Intradurale AV -Malformationen sind Fehlbildungen von medullären 
Blutgefäßen und liegen daher auf dem oder im Rückenmark. 
• Es treten Symptome meist bedingt durch intramedulläre oder subarachnoiale 
Blutungen oder kongestive venöse Ischämien mit chronisch progredienter 
Rückenmarkschädigung auf. Nota bene: Anders als bei Durafisteln treten bei 
den intraduralen AV-Malformationen Blutungen im Rückenmark oder dessen 
Umgebung auf. 
• Zumeist werden spinale AV-Malformationen im 2. oder 3. Lebensjahrzehnt 
symptomatisch. 
• Der Nachweis einer spinalen AV-Malformationen erfolgt mit der spinalen 
Angiographie AV-Malformationen. 
 
 Welche venösen relevanten spinalen Gefäßmalformationen kennen Sie? 
• Spinale kavernöse Hämangiome (Kavernome) sind vaskuläre 
Malformationen mit venösem Wandaufbau. 
• Sie sind auch mit der spinalen Angiographie meistens nicht nachweisbar, 
entgehen jedoch kaum dem Nachweis in der MRT. 

54 
 
• Klinisch werden Kavernome eher zwischen dem 15. und 60. Lebensjahr 
symptomatisch. 
• Morphologisch können eine progrediente Myelopathie, eine spinale 
Subarachnoidalblutung oder eine Hämatomyelieauftreten. 
 
 Ischämischer Infarkt 
 
 Was ist beim Nachweis eines spinalen ischaemischen Infarktes zu beachten? 
• Differentialdiagnostisch ist die Abgrenzung zu einer AV-Malformation oder 
einer entzündlichen Rückenmarkserkrankung (Querschnittmyelitis, 
Encephalomyelitis disseminata etc.) bisweilen schwer. 
• Klinisches Leitsymptom der akuten ischämischen Myelomalazie ist das 
akute sensomotorische Querschnittsyndrom, oft mit radikulären Schmerzen 
und Blasen-Mastdarm-Störungen. 
• Typische Lokalisationen sind die thorakolumbale Intumeszenz und der 
Conus medullaris, selten auch das Zervikalmark. 
• Der Nachweis der oft stiftförmigen Läsionen erfolgt mit der MRT am 
verlässlichsten mit T2-gewichteten SE-Sequenzen. 
 
 Spontanes Epiduralhämatom 
 
 Nennen Sie einige Charakteristika des spontanen epiduralen Hämotoms? 
• Es handelt sich um nichttraumatische Blutungen mit Ausgang vom 
epiduralen Venenplexus. 
• Diese Blutungen sind äußerst selten. Bei spontanen epiduralen Hämatomen 
liegen zumeist Gerinnungsstörungen vor, wobei nach einer 
vorangegangenen Lumbalpunktion zu fanden ist. 
• Neurologische Symptome hängen primär von der Raumforderung ab, wobei 
das Spektrum von radikulären Ausfällen bis zum Querschnittssyndrom 
reicht. 
• Der Nachweis erfolgt mit der MRT.

Muskuloskelettale Radiologie 
 
 Einleitung 
 
Die Muskuloskelettale Bildgebung schließt alle Aspekte der medizinischen 
Bildgebung ein. Insbesondere schließt die Anatomie, Funktion, Krankheit und 
jene Teile der interventionellen Radiologie und minimalen invasiven Therapie ein 
soweit sie das muskuloskelettale System betrifft. Das betrifft daher die Bildgebung 
in Orthopädie, Trauma, Rheumatologie, metabolische und endokrine 
Erkrankungen aber auch Aspekte der pädiatrischen und onkologischen 
Radiologie. Die Bildgebung der Wirbelsäule betrifft sowohl den muskuloskelettalen 
als auch den neuroradiologischen Bereich. 
 
 Basiswissen 
Der Begriff .„Basiswissen.“ wie er in diesem Dokument verwendet wird, ist jenes 
Wissen, das ein kompetenter Radiologe nach seiner Ausbildung haben muss. Es 
stellt daher einen essentiellen Bestandteil der Ausbildung dar. Im Bereich des 
muskuloskelettalen System umfasst es somit Anatomie, radiologische Technik, 
sowie 
 grundlegendes klinisches Wissen (Innere Medizin, Chirurgie, Pathologie und 
Pathophysiologie, soweit es das muskuloskelettale System betrifft) 
 Wissen um .„good clinical practice.“ 
 Wissen um die Indikationen, Kontraindikationen sowie potentielle Gefahren 
(insbesondere ionisierender Strahlung und MR) im Bereich des 
muskuloskelettalen System zum Einsatz gelangender Verfahren und 
Techniken, und 
 Wissen um und Management von Komplikationen. 
 Kenntnis der muskuloskelettalen Anatomie soweit sie für die klinische 
Diagnose relevant ist. 
 Kenntnis der normalen Varianten soweit sie Krankheiten imitieren können. 
 Kenntnis der muskuloskelettale Erkrankungen und Trauma soweit sie in konv. 
Radiologie, CT, MRT, Arthrographie, nuklearmedizinisch sowie sonographisch 
nachweisbar sind. 
 Kenntnis der Differentialdiagnosen. 
 
 Erstes Ausbildungsjahr 
 
Für die meisten Auszubildenden ist das erste Ausbildungsjahr auch die erste 
Möglichkeit, sich radiologische Fähigkeiten anzueignen. Am Ende des ersten 
Ausbildungsjahres sind die Grundlagen der Radiologie, namentlich Anatomie, 
Physik und radiologische Technik abgedeckt. Dazu wird Basiswissen über die, für 
die Bildgebung des muskuloskelettalen Systems relevante, regionale Anatomie 
sowie die technischen Aspekte der basalen radiologischen Prozeduren erworben. 

107 
 
Die Auszubildenden sollten mit den unten angeführten Techniken und deren 
Anwendung auf das muskuloskelettalen System vertraut werden. Die unter 
Basiswissen/-fähigkeiten angeführten Techniken werden unter Aufsicht eines 
anerkannten Ausbildner erlernt und ausgeführt. Von den optionalen Techniken 
sollten so viele wie möglich überblicksmäßig erlernt werden. Diese optionalen 
Techniken werden Lernziele des Basiswissen/-fähigkeiten im zweiten bis vierten 
Ausbildungsjahr.

 Zweites bis viertes Ausbildungsjahr 
Während des zweiten, dritten und vierten Ausbildungsjahres sollten die 
Auszubildenden eine strukturierte Ausbildung in allen Subspezialitäten der 
klinischen Radiologie erhalten. Dies kann in einer modularen Form erfolgen, mit 
entsprechenden Erweiterungen um organsystembasierte, technikbasierte, 
krankheitsbasierte oder altersbasierte Subspezialitäten. Alternativ kann die 
Ausbildung, abhängig vom Ausbildungsprogramm und der klinischen 
Verfügbarkeit, in einer mehr generalisierten Form erfolgen, mit Ausbildung in zwei 
oder mehr Organsystemen zu jedem gegebenen Zeitpunkt. Welche Form auch 
immer gewählt wird, sollte der muskuloskelettale Teil des zweiten bis vierten 
Ausbildungsjahres annähernd 17 Wochen dauern. Dabei sollte beachtet werden, 
dass muskuloskelettale Bildgebung Teil der pädiatrischen und Notfall-Radiologie 
und in einem geringeren Ausmaß Teil der onkologischen Radiologie ist.

 Ziele der Teilausbildung Kinderradiologie sind: 
 
 Eine allgemeine Einführung in die Kinderradiologie 
 Erwerb ausreichender Kenntnisse, um vom Erwachsenen abweichende 
pädiatrische Normalbefunde, Normvarianten oder typische pädiatrische 
pathologische Befunde zumindest zu erkennen und zu entscheiden, ob und 
welche (spezielle pädiatrische) bildgebende Verfahren oder Interventionen 
einzusetzen sind. 
 
 Dauer der pädiatrischen Ausbildung: 
 
12 Wochen 
 
 Ausbildungsverantwortlicher:

sollte.“ 
 
Das Spezialgebiet Kinderradiologie erstreckt sich auf sämtliche Organe und 
Körperregionen. Die allgemeinen Grundlagen sollten in den anderen 
Ausbildungsabschnitten bereits erworben worden sein, die kinderradiologische 
Ausbildung bezieht sich speziell auf die einschlägige Altersgruppe (PatientInnen 
unter 16 Jahren). 
Zur Kinderradiologie gehört weiters die fetale Bildgebung; besondere Bedeutung 
kommt seit der Einführung des fetalen Screenings dem perinatalen 
Bildgebungsmanagement 
zu, welches zu den zentralen Aufgaben des Kinderradiologen/der 
Kinderradiologin zu zählen ist. 
Besonderes Augenmerk in der Ausbildung sollte auf die bildgebende Diagnostik und 
Intervention bei Säuglingen, Kleinkindern und Schulkindern gelegt werden. In der

und sind daher für die Absolvierung der urogenitalen Ausbildung keine 
grundsätzliche Voraussetzung. Es wird aber vom/von der 
Ausbildungsarzt/ärztin sehr wohl die Erlernung von Bildgebungs-gestützten 
Biopsien von Nieren, Nebennieren, Lymphknoten und der Prostata, letztere in 
bestimmten Zentren und in Zusammenarbeit mit klinischen Kollegen. Weiters 
sollte auch die Drainage von Läsionen in Organen des Urogenitaltrakts bzw. 
Retroperitoneums (z. B. Abszessdrainage, Nephrostomie) erlernt werden. 
 Die Teilnahme an klinischen Besprechungen wird erwartet 
 Der/die Ausbildungsarzt/ärztin sollte vertraut sein mit der aktuellen Literatur 
der urogenitalen Bildgebung durch Studium der wichtigsten Lehrbücher sowie 
von Originalarbeiten in Fachzeitschriften. Ausbildungsärzte sollten angeleitet 
werden, an wissenschaftlichen Projekten teilzunehmen und Kenntnisse über 
Design, Ausführung und Analyse von wissenschaftlichen Projekten erlangen. 
Sie sollten ermutigt werden wissenschaftliche Arbeiten auf internationalen 
Kongressen zu präsentieren.
